**Smart Screen Unlocker Recovery** is an advanced, automation-driven forensic and accessibility framework. It is specifically engineered to help mobile technicians, forensic experts, and everyday users recover access to Android devices with **completely broken displays, dead touch digitizers, or inaccessible screens**. 

By injecting raw kernel-level touch gestures via an authorized ADB (Android Debug Bridge) interface, this tool acts as a synthetic hardware digitizer, allowing you to input your known pattern and recover your data.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE:** This is **NOT** a cracking, brute-forcing, or bypassing tool. It requires the device to have USB Debugging enabled, an authorized RSA fingerprint with the host PC, and the user MUST know the correct lock screen pattern.

## 🔥 Unrivaled Features & Capabilities

* **🛡️ Multi-State Awareness (AFU/BFU):** Dynamically detects if the device is in *Before First Unlock (BFU)* or *After First Unlock (AFU)* states and adjusts the vertical matrix geometry accordingly.
* **📐 Smart XML Container Bypassing:** Intelligently ignores fake, full-screen transparent containers deployed by modern security patches (e.g., Samsung OneUI 8+) to locate the true lock screen grid.
* **🎨 Interactive Visual GUI:** Features a sleek, terminal-spawned graphical canvas allowing the technician to visually draw the pattern using a mouse, mirroring physical device interaction.
* **⏱️ Auto-Timeout Prevention:** Automatically boosts the device's `screen_off_timeout` to 5 minutes during the operation to prevent screen sleep, seamlessly restoring the original settings post-injection.
* **✅ Deep Kernel Verification:** Interrogates the Android OS (`dumpsys window` & `dumpsys keyguard`) to mathematically verify a successful unlock without relying on visual screen feedback.

## ⚙️ The 6-Engine Multi-Attack Strategy

To account for fragmentation across Android OEMs, DPI scaling, and custom UIs, this tool utilizes a sequential cascade of mathematical engines. If one fails, the script dynamically adjusts its geometry and fires the next!

| Engine | Strategy Name | Description | Target Devices |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `Dynamic XML Hierarchy` | Attempts to pull the exact pixel bounds directly from the UI Automator tree. | Universal (If not blocked) |
| **2** | `Golden Ratio Base Matrix`| Uses empirical OEM aspect ratios to calculate a mathematically perfect square or rectangle grid. | Samsung & Generic AOSP |
| **3** | `DPI Shifted Matrix` | Compensates for users who have altered their display scaling (Small/Large UI sizes). | Universal |
| **4** | `Custom High Matrix` | Targets shifted notification shade layouts, commonly found in Android 13+ environments. | Samsung & Custom ROMs |
| **5** | `Custom Extreme Matrix` | Built from extreme-case hardware telemetry for unique screen resolutions. | Tall Aspect Ratios (21:9) |
| **6** | `Cross-Over Failsafe` | Tests BFU matrices on AFU states (and vice-versa) in case of Knox or SystemUI desynchronization. | Universal |

## 📱 Supported & Tested Devices

This framework calculates screen matrices dynamically, making it theoretically compatible with **any Android device**. However, it has been rigorously tested and optimized for the following architectures:

| OEM / Brand | Tested Models (Examples) | UI Environment | Success Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Samsung** | Galaxy S24 (SM-S921U), Galaxy S23 (SM-S911U) | OneUI 5.0 - 8.5 | 🟢 100% |
| **TCL** | T609DL, 30 SE, 40 XL | TCL UI / AOSP 12-13 | 🟢 100% |
| **Xiaomi / POCO**| Redmi Note 12, POCO X5 | MIUI 14 / HyperOS | 🟢 High |
| **Motorola** | Moto G Stylus, Edge series | MyUX / AOSP | 🟢 High |
| **Google** | Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8 | Pixel UI | 🟢 High |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 📦 Option 1: Standalone Windows Executable (Recommended)
You do not need Python installed. Simply download the standalone `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/alisakkaf/Smart-Screen-Unlocker-Recovery/releases) tab.

1. Ensure **USB Debugging** is enabled on the target Android device.
2. Connect the device to your PC and authorize the connection.
3. Run `Smart_Screen_Unlocker.exe`.
4. Draw your pattern on the interactive GUI and watch the terminal automate the injection!

### 💻 Option 2: Running from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/alisakkaf/Smart-Screen-Unlocker-Recovery.git](https://github.com/alisakkaf/Smart-Screen-Unlocker-Recovery.git)
cd Smart-Screen-Unlocker-Recovery

# Install build dependencies (optional, for compiling)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execute the script
python main.py 

```

## 🛠️ Compiling to .exe (For Developers)

To bundle the utility into a portable runtime executable with your custom icon (`6437133.png`), execute this command in your PowerShell/CMD:

```powershell
python -c "from PIL import Image; img = Image.open('6437133.png'); img.save('icon.ico', format='ICO')" ; pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --console --icon="icon.ico" --name="Smart_Screen_Unlocker" --clean main.py 

```
